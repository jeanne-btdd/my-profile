	 <h1>Hello, I'm Jeanne 🦋</h1>
	<img src="images/profile-picture.png" class="img-circle" width="100px" alt="Jeanne Berthold">
	<p>I love music, dancing, cooking, painting, travelling, visiting new areas… well I am always looking for new adventures! However, the past few years, I discovered a real appeal for everything that is closely or remotely linked with art and esthetics. I did a first internship in the cosmetic brand Docteur Pierre Ricaud and a second one in a photographic studio in Paris called Atelier Mai 98 specialized in culinary and luxury photography.

 <h2>Places around the world 🌍</h2>
	<p>I had the opportunity to travel and discover beautiful places, sometimes full of stories, of emotions, of memories or just full of beauty. Here are some of my favorites : the Stromboli in Sicilia 🌋, Koh Panyi in Thailande 🕌, the sunset in front of the sea in Biarritz 🏄, Antilope Canyon in the United States ⛺️, the Forest in Villard de Lans covered with snow 🏔, the "Pont des Arts" in Paris 💋 </p> </div>

<h2>Exibitions 👩🎨 </h2>
<p>When I have some free time, I like visiting museums or art galleries in order to see exhibitions.  From architecture and design to painting, including sculpture, photography, fashion designs, modern art… I am opened to all sorts of artistic and creative expressions! 🖼</div>

	<h2>Friends 🎪</h2>
	<p> Discovering new areas, new activities without sharing it with some friends would be boring! Strolling in Paris' streets, having a drink in a cool bar, dancing all together all night long, chatting on the phone on the way home from school... I guess spending time with your friends is the greatest thing!🕺</p></div>
